# AutoComplete

[Live Demo](http://www.tteebken.com/auto-complete)

I wanted to experiment with data structures and one that has always interested me is the Trie Data Structure. Using Angular 8, I built auto-complete functionality that is similar to Google's.

# Instructions

It's best to use phrases that are similar such as:

1. "Travel from LA to Tokyo"
2. "Travel from LA to New York"
3. "Travel from LA to Chicago"

Typing in one phrase and pushing enter inserts that word into the Trie tree. Typing in another phrase will show the previously entered phrase.

Results can be cycled through using the up "&#8593;" and down "&#8595;" arrow keys. The highlighted result can be added to the input by pushing the "Shift" key.
